When the CTRL modifier is activated, SDL2 does not generate `SDL_TEXTINPUT` events 
meanning that the code can only use the information provided in `SDL_KEYPRESS` ;
that is the 'keycode' and the 'modifiers' bits

This is problematic because because there is no practical way to figure out which 
character should be used when Shift or AltGr is active. For example, if an application 
want to handle `ctrl-@` then it should detect `Shift-2` with the US qwerty layout, 
`Shift-'` with the UK qwerty layout and `AltGr-Ã ` with the French azerty layout.

This is not feasible with the current API since the layout is not and should not 
be exposed to the user.

The proposed solution is to produce a new event of kind `SDL_TEXTINPUTCTRL` that 
will be emited when `CTRL` prevents the production of `SDL_TEXTINPUT`. This is a 
non-breaking change since old applications will ignore the new events.

This fork implements a proof of concept for the `wayland` and `x11` backends.

## Quick Test without installing

The program `test/checkkeys.c` was modified to show the new events. 

Run `configure` and `make` as usual. 

Then run `./run-checkkeys.sh -w` for the Wayland backend or `./run-checkkeys.sh -x` for 
the X11 backend.

The output should contain some **INPUTCTRL** when using CTRL.

This is not well tested but the reported text appear correct even when
using Shift, AltGr or the Compose feature.

Remark: CTRL only need to be pressed with the last key that produces the text.

# Note about the modified files

All changes are annotated with a comment containing `SCHAUVEAU`.

The modified files are 
- `test/checkkey.c`
- `include/SDL_events.h` to add the new `SDL_TEXTINPUTCTRL` event.
- `src/video/x11/SDL_x11events.c` for x11
- `src/video/wayland/SDL_waylandevents.c` for wayland
- `src/events/SDL_keyboard.c` and `src/events/SDL_keyboard_h.c` to add 
   function to send the new event.
